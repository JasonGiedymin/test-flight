Templates
_________

## Naming

Template names should be as they expect to be reified but with the tmpl
extension. For example:

  - `Dockerfile` becomes `Dockerfile.tmpl`
  - `my_text_file.txt` becomes `my_text_file.txt.tmpl`

Nested templates should follow the filename with the nested name following
after. For example:

  - `Dockerfile_add.tmpl`
  - `my_text_file_header.tmpl`

Note: Template naming is subject to change.
