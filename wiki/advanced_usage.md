Test-Flight Advanced Usage
--------------------------

Test-Flight affords you nearly complete control of the underlying docker
creation as well as the playbook execution.

You have access to:

  - the base templates which are used to run docker and ansible
  - the `test-flight-config.json` file which populates the template
  - the `build.json` file which also helps to populate the template but is
    part of a playbook's repository.

In the near future will be user defined template vars and plugins.
